EasyMedia - Increase the maximum upload file size limit to any value. Increase upload limit - upload large files effortlessly.


== Description ==

### **Increases the upload file size limit to any value with one click**
The **EasyMedia** plugin automatically detects your WordPress and server upload limits, displaying them in a simple dashboard. Instantly increase your upload size and easily upload large files like backups, videos, or ZIP archives directly to your WordPress media library — even if your hosting restricts upload limits.


### If you ever searched for:
- “Increase WordPress upload limit plugin”
- “Best plugin to upload large files”
- “Set upload quota for users or roles”
- “Restrict file types for authors”
- “Show upload logs in WordPress”
- “Media manager plugin with file stats”

✅ Then **EasyMedia** is the solution you need.


### 🧩 **Core Features (Free Version)**

**🔼 Increase Upload File Size Limit**
Raise your WordPress upload limit to any value without editing code or php.ini files. Upload big videos, ZIPs, and backups seamlessly.

**⏱️ Increase Maximum Execution Time**
Avoid “Maximum Execution Time Exceeded” errors. Increase execution time to handle large file uploads smoothly.

**👥 Role-Based Upload Limits**
Set custom upload size limits for different WordPress roles (Administrator, Editor, Author, etc.) to prevent storage overuse.

**💾 Memory Limit Set**
Large file uploads often fail due to low PHP memory limits. You can easily increase the memory limit from the plugin setting page.

**💽 System Status Dashboard**
View your current PHP upload limit, max execution time, memory limit, and other important settings at a glance.

**🧰 Simple, Clean UI**
Access settings easily from your WP **Dashboard → Media → EasyMedia**.


### **Where to find the Option to Increase Upload Limit.**
After installing and activating the plugin, go to your dashboard and navigate to **Media > EasyMedia**. From there, you can easily adjust your upload limits and execution time settings.

### **Increase Maximum Execution Time.**
Sometimes WordPress users can't upload new files due to extended execution time limits. With this plugin, you can increase the execution time to avoid these issues. Simply set the execution time in the input field according to your needs.

### **Plugin Renamed: MaxUploader is now EasyMedia** ###
We’ve rebranded MaxUploader to EasyMedia for a better, more user-friendly experience.
Don’t worry — all your existing settings will remain intact. The plugin continues to provide the same core functionality, including increasing upload file size limits and execution time, with an improved interface and additional features.

If you previously used MaxUploader, you can safely update to EasyMedia — it’s the same plugin, just with a new name and enhanced design.

**Pro Features Include:**

* **📊 Upload Logs & Tracking** - Monitor all file uploads with detailed logging, including user, file name, size, type, and timestamp. With the EasyMedia Pro Upload Logs module, you can see where each attachment is used across your site (posts, pages, or products).

* **👥 Set User Storage Disk Limit** - Set individual upload limits for specific users that override global settings. With this module, you can specially set the disk limit per individual user. This way we can handle over upload issue from the Editor and Author

* **📄 File Type Restriction** - The EasyMedia plugin sets user file type restriction. With this module, you can only allow specific types of files for the user. Sometimes, Editor or Author roles only need specific file types (like images), and ZIP or executable uploads can be disallowed for them. This feature makes that possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with all servers and hosting providers? =

Yes, it works with all servers. However, please note that server-adjusted limits can't be changed from a WordPress plugin. If the server's set limit is 16MB, you can't increase it to 128MB via WordPress. However, in that case, we chunk the large uploaded file into smaller pieces as a reflection of the upload time, which can be slower. But its possible to upload a big file if your server set upload limit is higher. Install the plugin, and it'll inform you of the limits and the necessary actions.

= Increase upload file size, but still not working? =

If the minimum upload limit is set by the hosting provider, then it will not work. Ask your hosting provider to increase the upload size.

= Increase maximum execution time, but not working? =

Usually, we upload large files by chunking to a small size, but if your WordPress upload directory is protected, then we can't create a chunk directory. Please open a support ticket — our team will investigate and help resolve the issue.

= What's the difference between free and pro versions? =

The free version allows you to increase upload limits and execution time. The pro version adds advanced features like upload logging, user-based limits, role restrictions, statistics dashboard, and enhanced media library display.

Yes! You can upgrade anytime. The pro version works alongside the free version and adds additional features without affecting your current settings.

= Do I get support with the free version? =

Yes, we provide community support for the free version. Pro users get priority support with faster response times.
