### **Increases the upload file size limit to any value with one click**

Instantly increase your upload size and easily upload large files like backups, videos, or ZIP archives directly to your WordPress media library — even if your hosting restricts upload limits.

Access the plugin's settings from the main WP admin menu. Media -> EasyMedia

You can increase the maximum upload file size and WordPress maximum execution time. Some time extended maximum execution time is needed when uploading large attachments. With this plugin you can simply avoid this problem and manage your media uploads efficiently.

### **Where to find Option to Increase Upload Limit.**
After installing and activating the plugin, go to your dashboard and navigate to Media > EasyMedia. From there, you can easily adjust your upload limits and execution time settings.

### **Increase Maximum Execution Time.**
Sometimes WordPress users can't upload new files due to extended execution time limits. With this plugin, you can increase the execution time to avoid these issues. Simply set the execution time in the input field according to your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with all servers and hosting providers? =

Yes, it works with all servers. However, please note that server-adjusted limits can't be changed from a WordPress plugin. If the server set limit is 16MB you can't increase it to 128MB via WordPress. But that case we chunk the large uploaded file in small peace as a refection upload time can be slower. But its possible to upload big file than your server set upload limit. Install the plugin and it'll tell you what the limits are and what to do.

= Increase upload file size but still not working? =

If minimum upload limit is set by hosting provider then it will not work. Ask your hosting provider to increase upload size.

= Increase maximum execution time but not working? =
